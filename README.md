Dynatrace Nodejs SDK Socket.io Wrapper
## Status:
Incomplete 

## About: 

This will essentially make use of the trace messaging API for Dynatrace: 
https://github.com/Dynatrace/OneAgent-SDK-for-NodeJs/tree/cc8b86c3229199b99595db4c03b26d7862fae886#trace-messaging

This project is not supported by dynatrace. 

Note: this is a hack-y way of doing this for now.
